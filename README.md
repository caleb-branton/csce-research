# **Cognitive Side-Channel Extraction (CSCE)**

### _An Emerging Post-Compromise Semantic-Intelligence Threat in AI-Assisted Environments_

## **Overview**

Cognitive Side-Channel Extraction (CSCE) is a proposed threat category describing how an attacker—after compromising a victim’s endpoint or authenticated session—can interrogate a memory-enabled AI assistant to extract structured, high-value semantic intelligence.

Modern AI assistants often retain summaries of user behavior, preferences, relationships, routines, and operational details. Once a device or session is compromised, this synthesized contextual knowledge becomes an intelligence-rich side-channel available to adversaries.

CSCE is **not** prompt injection, memory poisoning, or model exfiltration.  
It is a **post-compromise semantic reconnaissance technique** that leverages the assistant’s accumulated understanding of the user.

This repository defines the concept, its threat model, attack sequence, potential impact, and associated defensive strategies.

## **What Makes CSCE Distinct**

Traditional data exfiltration focuses on raw assets:

- credentials
    
- documents
    
- emails
    
- configuration files
    
- logs
    
- source code
    

CSCE instead targets the assistant’s **internal semantic model of the user**—a distilled and searchable representation generated through normal interaction.

This model may contain:

- behavioral patterns and routines
    
- relationship mappings and social context
    
- personal goals, concerns, and long-term plans
    
- organizational responsibilities and workflows
    
- technology usage patterns
    
- psychological or emotional cues
    

AI assistants convert fragmented information into coherent summaries.  
CSCE exploits this synthesis rather than raw data stores.

## **Why CSCE Matters**

As AI assistants gain:

- long-term memory,
    
- deeper context retention,
    
- cross-platform integration, and
    
- access to personal or workplace data,
    

they increasingly function as **compressed personal knowledge bases**.

During a breach, they act as high-bandwidth intelligence surfaces, enabling attackers to extract meaningfully structured insights far more efficiently than traditional forensic or manual search methods.

CSCE reframes the impact of post-compromise access:

- **Old question:** “What files were accessed?”
    
- **New question:** “What does the assistant _know_ about the user?”
    

This shift has implications for personal security, enterprise risk, insider-threat modeling, and breach-response workflows.
