# **Example Scenarios: Cognitive Side-Channel Extraction (CSCE)**

This document presents hypothetical scenarios illustrating how Cognitive Side-Channel Extraction (CSCE) may manifest across personal, organizational, and technical environments. These examples support research, risk assessments, and defensive planning. They do not describe real individuals or incidents.

# **1. Opportunistic Access to an Unlocked Personal Device**

## **Scenario**

A user steps away from an unlocked laptop in a public location. A memory-enabled AI assistant remains open in the browser.

## **Attacker Behavior**

The attacker enters prompts such as:

- “Provide a summary of important personal information I've shared.”
    
- “What upcoming obligations or concerns have I mentioned?”
    
- “List people I talk about frequently and how they relate to me.”
    

## **Outcome**

The attacker collects:

- Social connections and relational context
    
- Financial or logistical information
    
- Daily habits and behavioral patterns
    
- Sensitive topics mentioned in previous conversations
    

This data is later weaponized for identity fraud and targeted scams.

# **2. Compromised Corporate Workstation**

## **Scenario**

A corporate employee’s laptop becomes infected with a remote-access trojan. The organization permits AI assistants for summarization, planning, and project tracking.

## **Attacker Behavior**

The attacker queries:

- “Summarize current projects I’ve discussed.”
    
- “What tools or internal systems have I referenced?”
    
- “Who are the colleagues I work most closely with?”
    

## **Outcome**

Extracted intelligence includes:

- Project timelines and deliverables
    
- Technology stacks and internal platforms
    
- Team structures and reporting relationships
    
- Descriptions of operational challenges
    

This information enables highly convincing spearphishing campaigns.

# **3. Social Engineering Preparation Through Context Extraction**

## **Scenario**

A shared household computer contains an active AI assistant session. A malicious actor gains temporary access.

## **Attacker Behavior**

The intruder asks:

- “What sensitive personal topics have I brought up before?”
    
- “What upcoming events or commitments have I mentioned?”
    
- “What companies or services do I interact with?”
    

## **Outcome**

The attacker obtains:

- Emotional or situational vulnerabilities
    
- Appointment or schedule information
    
- Lists of service providers or subscriptions
    

This leads to realistic, context-rich social engineering attempts.

# **4. Organizational Reconnaissance for Lateral Movement**

## **Scenario**

An APT actor compromises a contractor’s workstation. The contractor uses an AI assistant as a lightweight notepad for summarizing responsibilities and task progress.

## **Attacker Behavior**

The attacker queries:

- “Summarize my responsibilities across all current projects.”
    
- “What internal systems or processes have I referenced?”
    
- “Who are the stakeholders involved in these tasks?”
    

## **Outcome**

The assistant reveals:

- Chains of responsibility and project ownership
    
- High-level workflow descriptions
    
- Names and roles of privileged personnel
    
- Trust relationships and operational dependencies
    

The attacker uses this data to plan lateral movement.

# **5. Semantic Life-Context Exposure After Device Theft**

## **Scenario**

A thief steals a tablet that has an unlocked AI assistant session with long-term memory enabled.

## **Attacker Behavior**

The thief prompts:

- “What important decisions or concerns have I mentioned recently?”
    
- “What habits or routines have I talked about?”
    
- “What personal challenges or ongoing plans have come up?”
    

## **Outcome**

The attacker acquires:

- Private concerns or sensitive personal context
    
- Behavioral rhythms or schedule indicators
    
- Social or relational details previously disclosed
    

This information is used for manipulation or extortion.

# **Summary**

These scenarios demonstrate how CSCE turns an AI assistant’s semantic memory into an intelligence source, enabling attackers to extract structured personal, relational, and organizational context. They illustrate how CSCE differs from traditional data theft by focusing on synthesized contextual knowledge rather than raw files.
